# COVID-19 Global Testing Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, you will assume the role of a **Data Analyst** who has recently joined the Data Science team of a news channel. The channel’s documentary team has accepted an assignment to create a feature story on **global COVID-19 testing by country**, and they need data-driven insights from your team.

As part of the team, you will use your **R programming skills** to acquire, process, and analyze the relevant datasets. The project leverages **Jupyter Notebook**, a powerful and interactive platform widely used for data analysis and data science tasks.

---

## Objective

* Acquire a global COVID-19 dataset from a public source.
* Perform data cleaning and processing to make the dataset analysis-ready.
* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.
* Provide visualizations and summaries that can support a news feature story.

---

## Lab Instructions

1. **Environment**: You will use the provided **Jupyter Notebook environment**, which can be accessed directly from your browser.
2. **Dataset Acquisition**: Use web scraping techniques to extract global COVID-19 testing data from a **public wiki page**.
3. **Data Processing**: Clean, organize, and process the dataset for analysis.
4. **Analysis Tasks**:

   * Calculate statistics like testing rates, total tests per country, and positive test ratios.
   * Identify trends, patterns, and outliers across countries.
   * Visualize key metrics using plots and charts for easy understanding.
5. **Provided Resources**: A **skeleton Jupyter Notebook** is provided, including tasks, sample code, and comments to guide your analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Programming Language**: R
* **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook
* **Key Packages**: `rvest`, `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and other relevant R libraries for web scraping and data visualization.

## Deliverables

* A completed **Jupyter Notebook** with:

  * Data acquisition and web scraping steps
  * Data cleaning and processing
  * Exploratory data analysis with insights
  * Visualizations supporting your analysis
